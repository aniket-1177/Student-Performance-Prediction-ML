## Overview

Predicting student performance is crucial for educational institutions to identify at-risk students and provide timely interventions. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze student data and predict their performance. The project follows a modular design, making it easy to understand, maintain, and extend.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion:**  Handles loading data from using `data_ingestion.py`.
- **Data Transformation:**  Performs data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering using `data_transformation.py`.
- **Model Training:**  Trains machine learning models using `model_trainer.py` with configurable hyperparameters.
- **Prediction Pipeline:**  Provides a streamlined pipeline for making predictions on new data using `predict_pipeline.py`.
- **Modular Design:**  Organized into reusable components and pipelines for easy maintenance and extension.
- **Logging and Exception Handling:**  Implements robust logging and exception handling for better monitoring and debugging.
